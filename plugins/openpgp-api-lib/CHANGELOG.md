# Version history

## Version 12
  * OpenPgpDecryptionResult and OpenPgpSignatureResult are now immutable
  * Added PROGRESS_MESSENGER and DATA_LENGTH extras for ACTION_DECRYPT_VERIFY. This allows to the client app to get periodic updates for displaying a progress bar on decryption.
  * Added ACTION_BACKUP
  * Added special API calls for better K-9 Mail integration:  
    Check for sender address matching with EXTRA_SENDER_ADDRESS and result in OpenPgpSignatureResult  
    Opportunistic encryption mode with EXTRA_OPPORTUNISTIC_ENCRYPTION  
    There is an external ContentProvider at org.sufficientlysecure.keychain.provider.exported for querying available keys (CAUTION: This API is not final!)

## Version 11
  * Added a simple no-op to check if the api is available and app has permission as ACTION_CHECK_PERMISSION
  * The ACTION_DETACHED_SIGN action now returns RESULT_SIGNATURE_MICALG, which contains the algorithm name used for signing (relevant for PGP/MIME)
