/**
 * {@code CoreService} is the base class for all K-9 Services.
 *
 * <p>
 * An Android service is a way to model a part of an application that needs to accomplish certain
 * tasks without the UI part of the application being necessarily active (of course an application
 * could also be a pure service, without any UI; this is not the case of K-9). By declaring a
 * service and starting it, the OS knows that the application has work to do and should avoid
 * killing the process.
 * </p><p>
 * A service's main purpose is to do some task (usually in the background) which requires one or
 * more threads. The thread that starts the service is the same as the UI thread of the process. It
 * should thus not be used to run the tasks.
 * </p><p>
 * CoreService is providing the execution plumbing for background tasks including the required
 * thread and task queuing for all XryptoMail services to use.
 * </p><p>
 * A service is supposed to run only as long as it has some work to do whether that work is active
 * processing or some just some monitoring, like listening on a network port for incoming connections
 * or listing on an open network connection for incoming data (push mechanism).
 * </p><p>
 * To make sure the service is running only when required, is must be shutdown after tasks are
 * done. As the execution of tasks is abstracted away in this class, it also handles proper
 * shutdown. If a Service doesn't want this, it needs to call {@code enableAutoShutdown(true)} in
 * its {@link Service#onCreate()} method.
 * </p><p>
 * While a service is running its tasks, it is usually not a good idea to let the device go to
 * sleep mode. Wake locks are used to avoid this. CoreService provides a central registry
 * (singleton) that can be used application-wide to store wake locks.
 * </p><p>
 * In short, CoreService provides the following features to K-9 Services:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>task execution and queuing</li>
 *   <li>Service life cycle management (ensures the service is stopped when not needed anymore);
 *       enabled by default</li>
 *   <li>wake lock registry and management</li>
 * </ul>
